# Development

## Initial setup
* Download [hemtt]([https://www.google.com](https://github.com/BrettMayson/HEMTT/releases)) and place it in the root directory of the git repository.
* Subscribe to the development mods listed in file "hemtt/launch.toml", section "workshop".


## Building the mod
* Run "hemtt dev" (Windows: "hemtt.exe dev") to create a dev build.
* Run "hemtt release" to create a signed release build.
* See the [full hemtt documentation](https://hemtt.dev/) for more information.


## Hot Reload - Editing code while Arma3 is running - Method 1
* Run the game via "hemtt launch" (Windows: "hemtt.exe launch")
  * This will create a symbolic link in the Arma3 game directory to hemtt dev build.
  * It will build the mod and run the game as defined in "hemtt/launch.toml".
* After a code change you need to restart the mission to apply the change.
  * You need to restart the game if you've added any files. You will also need to restart in some other special cases like new addon settings.

## Hot Reload - Editing code while Arma3 is running - Method 2
* Build the mod (either via "build.sh" or "hemtt dev"). This will create a development build in the project directory "hemttout/dev" (build.sh) or ".hemttout/dev" ("hemtt dev" cmd).
* Open Arma3 launcher, select "Mods", click on "Local mod", browse to the just reated development build of the mod (directory "hemttout/dev" or ".hemttout/dev").
* Enable "File Patching" in the Parameters of the Arma3 Launcher. This will allow you to rebuild and reload the mod while Arma3 is running. 
* After a code change you need to restart the mission to apply the change.
  * You need to restart the game if you've added any files. You will also need to restart in some other special cases like new addon settings.
